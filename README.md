This was an assignment I did during my course at Anhembi Morumbi Uni in Windows Forms. The assignment was to make
an application to buy and sell products as well as register information of clients and show information in alphabetical
order using some sorting algorithm. I generated the models from database using Entity Framework and added in them the method
“CompareTo” to use with QuickSort algorithm.
